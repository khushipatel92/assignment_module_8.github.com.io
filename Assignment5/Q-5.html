           â€¢ What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

         Answer:-
          
           -> Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's 
              built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes 
              together.

            -> Grid system is basically a set of imaginary and horizontal and vertical lines drawn on a map. The 
               horizontal lines are called latitudes and the vertical lines are called longitudes. The grid system is
               used to find the exact location of a place.  

            -> The fluid grid system in Bootstrap is a flexible and responsive way to create a page layout. It allows you
               to create complex layouts using a combination of rows and columns, and it automatically adjusts to the 
               size of the screen to ensure that the layout looks good on any device.

            -> * Equal-width. For example, here are two grid layouts that apply to every device and viewport, from xs to 
                 xl . ...

               * Setting one column width. ..

               * Equal-width multi-row. ...

               * All breakpoints. ...

               * Stacked to horizontal. ...

               * Mix and match. ...

               * Vertical alignment.   
   
            -> Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-built components, such as navigation bars, forms, buttons, and more, 
               saving you time and effort in coding from scratch. Bootstrap is easy to learn and implement, making it
               accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
