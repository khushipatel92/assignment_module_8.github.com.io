    <!-- Question:6
    
           â€¢ What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5

         Answer:-
         
            -> The form elements in Bootstrap 4 have defaulted to the browser-provided view. However, in Bootstrap 5, the 
               form elements have a custom design that enables them to have a consistent look and feel in all browsers.
               The new form controls are based on completely semantic, standard form controls.

            -> Bootstrap 4 uses Jekyll software. Bootstrap 5 uses Hugo software as it is fast static site generator. this 
               makes easier to implement vertical designs, and the columns and rows can easily be implemented. the 
               classes justify-center-content can directly be used to align according to the requirement.   

            -> Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap, which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
               framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites.

            -> This document guides you in migrating your customizations from bootstrap version 4 to version 5. Review 
               the changes and update your custom component scss and html files. Read and understand bootstrap and 
               ng-bootstrap migration documentation.   

            -> Bootstrap 5 is the latest version of Bootstrap. It has some new features and improvement over Bootstrap 4. 
               Bootstrap 4 supports IE10 and IE11 but it rely on jQuery. If you want to use the new features and 
               technologies, and you don't need to support older browsers, then Bootstrap 5 might be a better choice for 
               you.
