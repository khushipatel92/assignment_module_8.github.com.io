    <!-- Question:8
    
           • How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?

         Answer:-
         
            -> Step 1: You need to update the anchor tag to a new div tag, which has . thumbnail as a class.

               Step 2: In this div tag, we can add any media or text. This div tag is used for a span-based naming 
                       convention for sizing.

            ->* Open an image related to your video in an image editor. ...
   
              * Crop the image to a wide-screen format. ...
   
              * Resize the image to 1280 × 720 pixels. ...
   
              * Add a title to the image. ...
   
              * Save the image. ...
   
              * Add the image to a thumbnail image to a YouTube video.
           
            -> Create responsive images by adding an .img-responsive class to the <img> tag. The image will then scale
               nicely to the parent element.

            -> It's a reference to the human thumbnail and is used to describe the small size of an image, as in it's so
               small it's the size of a thumbnail. This term was used in this way to refer to images back in the 17th 
               century.
