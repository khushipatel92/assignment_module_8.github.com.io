          â€¢ In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?

        Answer:-
        
          -> Flexbox. The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox,
             instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible 
             responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

          -> Quickly manage the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, and more with a 
             full suite of responsive flexbox utilities. For more complex implementations, custom CSS may be necessary.

          -> Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to
             fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.
