            • What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?

         Answer:-
         
            -> “Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create a series of buttons in
                groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally. Syntax: This is the basic syntax of the button group 
                class where each button has its own class of “btn”.

            -> btn-group class is used to create horizontally arranged button groups. Example: html.28 Apr 2022

            -> For example, the default button group can be used when a form has both a primary and alternative action.
               Stepping through linear content. Buttons in a button group can be used for directional navigation and
               actions (e.g., “Back,” “Next,” “Continue,” “Skip,” “Cancel.”).
