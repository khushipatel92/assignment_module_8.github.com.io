    <!-- Question-2
    
           â€¢ What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

         Answer:-
         
            -> Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid 
               system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While
               containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

            -> Basically, there are three types of container classes available in bootstrap: Default-Container(container)
               Responsive-Container(along with sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) Fluid-Container(container-fluid)   

            -> Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

            -> The container class gives your webpage some basic margins and sets it in a way that it is easy to view on 
               all devices. This is specific to Bootstrap. Other frameworks may use the same name "container" or 
               something else for the same purpose.
