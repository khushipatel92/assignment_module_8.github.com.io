    <!-- Question:11
    
             â€¢ What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?

         Answer:-
         
             -> * Bootstrap Card Basics
          
                  To create Bootstrap cards, you need to understand the card class and its customizations and layouts. A
                  basic Bootstrap card consists of a . card class with the . card-body class, allowing you to add text,
                  images, links, and other Bootstrap elements within a rounded border.

             -> * import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap. min. css';

                * import {Container ,Card, CardGroup, Button} from 'react-bootstrap';

                * import img4 from './img4. jpg';

                * function App() {

                * return (

                * <div className="App">

                * <Container className='p-4'>

                * <CardGroup>  
                    
             -> To create a card structure, simply add a div container and customize it with CSS property. Add box-shadow
                property for card effect. Set some padding to the card and add some elements like links, images, etc to
                the card.
